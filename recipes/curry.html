            <li>
                Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. 
                Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package 
                of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering 
                until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.
            </li>
        </ol>
