        <h4 class="subheading small">Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul class="ingredients">
           <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
           <li>5 1/2 cups water, divided</li>
           <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1/4 cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
           <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li> 
        </ul>

        <h4 class="subheading small">Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. 
                Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water 
                is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide 
                cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. 
                Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice 
                to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice
            </li>
